                        <h3>Radar Gun- Baseball</h3>
                    </header>
                    <p>
                        Some may say that homerun review should succeed this, but since baseball is a very traditionalist sport 
                        and homerun reviews rarely happen, the radar gun gets the nod for baseball.
                        Every single pitch speed is documented and analyzed by the pitcher&apos;s team 
                        and opposing batters. The radar gun allows pitchers and their organizations to track development 
                        and pitch speed can either make or break a pitcher looking to make it into the Majors.                    
                        Hitters arguably use the radar gun more than pitchers do, because they can use it to 
                        examine the other starting pitcher and even use it to test their bat speed just as religiously 
                        as a pitcher would test their pitching speed.

                        <h3>Computerized Scoring- Bowling</h3>
                    </header>
                    <p>
                        To start off this list, let&apos;s talk about a piece of technology 
                        that helps the Average Joe more than the professional.
                        Now sports are for everyone (whether you call bowling a sport or not is your decision) 
                        and the difficulty of keeping score manually can put people off of the game. Bowling, in particular, 
                        can be difficult for the infrequent alley visitor to score, 
                        and throwing a computer into the equation eases the pain of scoring by 100 percent.
                        Having a computer keep the score for you can keep all your focus on 
                        your next ball rather than adding and multiplying pins.

                        <h3> Cyclops and Hawkeye Tracking System- Tennis</h3>
                    </header>
                    <p>
                        These two computerized ball trackers have changed the game of professional tennis forever, 
                        leading to precise calls and elimination of arguments.
                        The first computerized system to come to surface was the Cyclops, 
                        a system of six infra-red beams that rest just a centimeter above the ground. If the ball was hit inside the court, 
                        all other beams outside the court would shut off. 
                        If the ball was hit just outside the court, a sound would project and the play would be stopped. Easy as that.
                        A little more cutting-edge technology that is more commonly used now is the Hawkeye.
                        The logistics of how this system works is a little more difficult, but in a nut shell its multiple cameras 
                        from several angles that project ball flight. The cameras then calculate a 3-D image of where the ball lands 
                        and is up to the player to challenge after close shots following the umpire&apos;s initial call.
