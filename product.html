                        Many believe that apple could include the ability to detect whether or 
                        not you might be sick and should contact the doctor. Maybe adding glucose monitoring 
                        or adjusting the size of the screen so that is more suitable for certain types of workouts. 
                        These upgrades may not be on the products now, but they may be added soon. All we can do now is wait and see.</p>
